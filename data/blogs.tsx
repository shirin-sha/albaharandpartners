Organizations should maintain a clear inventory of endpoints, users, and critical systems, and continuously monitor for suspicious behavior. This is followed by strong access control—enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), least-privilege access, and secure onboarding/offboarding processes to reduce account misuse."
